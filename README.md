## Simple Calculator GUI in Java

This repository contains the source code for a simple calculator application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Java.

**functionalities:**

Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two real numbers.
An example of the input: 5+3 or 2.654/69 (limited to one operation and no brackets).
Use the double data type to hold real numbers.
Implement a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for input and output.
Handle various special cases and display error messages when necessary.
Maintain a history of the last five operations, allowing users to view and repeat them.
Navigation through next/previous operations updates the current operation.
The solution should utilize at least two classes.



**Features:**

* Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* Clear button to reset the calculator's state.
* Sign button to change the sign of the number.
* Simple and user-friendly interface.

**Requirements:**

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher

**How to Use:**

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project in a Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
3. Build and run the project.
4. Alternatively, you can download the compiled JAR file from the releases page and run it directly.


**Possible Improvements:**

* Add more advanced features, such as memory functions or trigonometric calculations.
* Improve the user interface with more customization options.
